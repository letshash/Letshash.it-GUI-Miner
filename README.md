# LetsHash.it-GUI-Miner

Based on [DeadSet CNGUIMINER](https://github.com/OptimusBlue/CNGUIMiner)

LetsHash.it GUI Miner written in C# for use at LetsHash.it Mining Pools.

# How to Use
Easily, just Download the files from Release page, unizip them with 7zip or WinRAR. Double click on LetsHash.it GUI Miner.exe, if you"re prompted to allow access xmr-stak to firewall ,just allow it to use web monitoring and statistics inside miner.

# Some important info
GUI Miner is built on xmr-stak miner, so your antivirus may detect it as CoinMiner virus, which is false positive.

If you want adjust or lower threads of your cpu, just click on "Advanced Setting" under Start Mining Tab. Or just go to pre-created config folder and edit your threads in it. Same method applies for NVIDIA/AMD configuration.

TBA : More miners for all coins on our pool coming soon, already working on them!! Also Thread column will be added in next update.

**I don"t included any hidden fees to the miner. All fees goes to the official developers of the miner.**
